# VoicemorfingDetection
Data Collection – Gather genuine and morphed audio samples for training and testing.

Preprocessing – Convert audio to a standard format, remove noise, and segment speech.

Feature Extraction – Extract features such as MFCCs, pitch, energy, and spectral properties from each audio sample.

Model Training – Use machine learning or deep learning models (e.g., CNN, LSTM) to learn patterns that distinguish real from morphed voices.

Detection – Input a new voice sample, extract features, and classify it as Genuine or Morphed.

Evaluation – Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to validate model performance.

Deployment – Integrate the trained model into a real-time detection system or web application.
